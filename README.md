## Project Overview
The Dice Roller Application is a Python command line application which I created at the start of my Python journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.
